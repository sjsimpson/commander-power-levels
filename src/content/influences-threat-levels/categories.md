We try to separate threats into 4 tiers, categorized primarily by the time frame you have to interact with them, or their “threat level horizon”.

- Tier 0 - Needs to be countered
- Tier 1 - Needs to be removed now
- Tier 2 - Needs to be removed this turn cycle
- Tier 3 - Needs to be removed in the next couple turns

### Tier Zero

Tier Zero threats care very little about existing board state, and can virtually end games with very little setup. These threats have a very small window of interaction, and most often need to be countered (if possible).

Examples:
Cyclonic Rift
Torment of Hailfire
Korvold (in a treasure deck)
Some assembled combos (that can win over-top of interaction)

### Tier One

Tier One threats will immediately start making a huge impact if they aren’t removed or dealt with immediately. They don’t necessarily need to be countered, but they need to be removed at the next possible opportunity.

Examples:
Consecrated Sphinx
Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur
Other assembled combos (that can be interacted with)
Things that trigger each turn

### Tier Two

Tier Two threats are probably okay to leave on the board for a turn cycle, but they can get very out of hand if they make it to their next turn. Many advantage engines fall into this category, as they often require stuff to happen AFTER they are played.

Examples:
Miirym
Toxrill (might be on the high end)
Sheoldred the Apocalypse (combo deck)
Tasigur, the Golden Fang (pod deck)
Smothering Tithe
Rhystic Study
Sheoldred, Whispering One

### Tier Three

Tier Three threats are very powerful cards and effects that don’t immediately threaten wins or large advantages, but can generate greater advantage over time.

Examples:
Sheoldred, the Apocalypse (in the 99)
Tasigur (as a value engine)
Zulaport Cutthroat example again
