We try to separate threats into 4 tiers, categorized primarily by the time frame you have to interact with them, or their “threat level horizon”.

- [**Tier 0**](#tier-0): Needs to be countered
- [**Tier 1**](#tier-1): Needs to be removed now
- [**Tier 2**](#tier-2): Needs to be removed this turn cycle
- [**Tier 3**](#tier-3): Needs to be removed in the next couple of turns

### Tier 0

Tier 0 threats care very little about existing board state, and can virtually end games with very little setup. These threats have a very small window of interaction, and most often need to be countered (if possible).

_Examples:_
[Cyclonic Rift](https://scryfall.com/card/rvr/40/cyclonic-rift),
[Torment of Hailfire](https://scryfall.com/card/hou/77/torment-of-hailfire),
[Korvold](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/329/korvold-fae-cursed-king) (in a treasure deck),
some assembled combos (that can win over-top of interaction)

### Tier 1

Tier 1 threats will immediately start making a huge impact if they aren’t removed or dealt with immediately. They don’t necessarily need to be countered, but they need to be removed at the next possible opportunity.

_Examples:_
[Consecrated Sphinx](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/43/consecrated-sphinx),
[Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/62/jin-gitaxias-core-augur),
other assembled combos (that can be interacted with),
things that trigger each turn

### Tier 2

Tier 2 threats are probably okay to leave on the board for a turn cycle, but they can get very out of hand if they make it to their next turn. Many advantage engines fall into this category, as they often require stuff to happen _after_ they are played.

_Examples:_
[Miirym, Sentinel Wyrm](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/284/miirym-sentinel-wyrm),
[Toxrill, The Corrosive](https://scryfall.com/card/vow/132/toxrill-the-corrosive),
[Sheoldred the Apocalypse](https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/107/sheoldred-the-apocalypse) (combo deck),
[Tasigur, the Golden Fang](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/117/tasigur-the-golden-fang) (pod deck),
[Smothering Tithe](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/57/smothering-tithe),
[Rhystic Study](https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/169/rhystic-study),

### Tier 3

Tier 3 threats are very powerful cards and effects that don’t immediately threaten wins or large advantages, but can generate greater advantage over time.

_Examples:_
[Sheoldred the Apocalypse](https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/107/sheoldred-the-apocalypse) (in the 99),
[Tasigur, the Golden Fang](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/117/tasigur-the-golden-fang) (as a value engine),
[Zulaport Cutthroat](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/775/zulaport-cutthroat)
