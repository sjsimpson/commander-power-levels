While we use these categories to determine which threat levels to include in our decks, it’s also important to let them educate the [interaction](../deckbuilding/interaction) you are playing as well.

Ask yourself, “What kind of threats do I expect to see at this power level?” and include an appropriate quality and quantity of [interaction](../deckbuilding/interaction) to defend yourself against those threats.
