When considering including a given effect, it’s important to ask yourself 2 questions:

1. What is the threat level of this card?
2. Would decks at my desired power level be equipped to deal with it in a timely manner?

Let’s imagine we are considering putting a [Kiki-Jiki](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/136/kiki-jiki-mirror-breaker) combo line in your [Mid-power](../power-levels#mid) deck as a win condition. Depending on the line, we would consider that a [Tier 0](./threat-levels#tier-0) or [Tier 1](./threat-levels#tier-1) threat. Would [Mid-power](../power-levels#mid) decks be equipped to interact with that combo? Potentially… they may run the appropriate types of [interaction](../deckbulding/interaction) to stop this combo. But they likely wouldn’t expect a [Mid-power](../power-levels#mid) deck to even run an efficient Kiki-Jiki line.

For [vegetables](../assumptions#vegetables), which are threats in their own right, a more pertinent question is usually “where does this fall on the distribution of this kind of effect?”

We typically don’t play cards like Rhystic Study or Smothering Tithe in [Mid-power](../power-levels#mid) decks, because while they probably represent a only [Tier 2](./threat-levels#tier-2), they are the best at what they do.
