Power levels are a way to describe the expected play experience of a Commander
deck. Since Commander is a casual, multiplayer format, it's crucial for players to agree on a shared play experience to achieve balance and ensure enjoyment in their games.

A scale from 1-10 has long been used to describe the power level of a deck and
act as a “shortcut” for the deck’s relative strength and play patterns in
pregame discussions. This way of describing power levels has been unproductive
at best. We believe that this is primarily due to the qualitative nature of
the discussion.

The purpose of this resource is to provide Commander players with tools for
building decks to specific power levels, evaluating the power levels of cards
and decks, and having more productive Rule 0 discussions.
