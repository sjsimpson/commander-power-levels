While your [vegetables](/assumptions#vegetables) contribute pretty heavily to the overall power level of your deck, there are plenty of other factors to consider.

In this section, we talk about [Strategy](/influences/strategies), [Threat Levels](/influences/threat-levels), [Tutors](/influences/tutors), and [Combos](/influences/combos), how those contribute to the power level of your deck. We also give guidelines specifically around Tutors and Combos and at what power levels we typically decide to put them into our decks.
