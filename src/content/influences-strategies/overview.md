The strategy of your deck is one of the biggest contributors to its power level, and some strategies are simply more powerful than others. Even if you attempt to build “lower power” or “janky” versions, some strategies will simply outperform the rest of the table.

Some favorite examples are things like Vadrik, Astral Archmage or Malcolm & Breeches. Even with a $25 budget, and playing relatively inefficient cards, these decks can present wins as early as turn 3.

When building your deck, be wary of the strategy you are playing, and whether it is well-suited to be played at your desired power level.
