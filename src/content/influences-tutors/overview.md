Tutors are very powerful and act as redundancy for effects in your deck. We have found that tutors can warp the power level of a deck more than most other cards, as they can as an additional copy of the best card in your deck at any given moment. With broad tutors, you can find a [combo](./influences/combos) piece, a [value engine](../deckbuilding/card-advantage#engines), or [interaction](../deckbuilding/interaction).

When including tutors in your deck, a good question to ask yourself is: "What do I plan on tutoring for?" What you are searching for and whether your tutor can find it, will affect the power level of your deck.

Generally speaking, we avoid playing tutors in [Low](../power-levels#low) to [Mid-power](../power-levels#mid) decks, and reserve them for higher power.

In [High Mid-power](../power-levels#high-mid) decks, we will typically play narrow tutors that can get a value engine, but wonâ€™t be looking for infinite combos. In [High-power](../power-levels#high) decks, we play any tutor we can, and use them to search for value engines early, and win conditions later.

If you want to play a tutor at a lower power level, that is your prerogative. However, we have discovered that tutors will highlight the power level outliers in your deck, and you may find yourself sandbagging your tutors (which never feels good).
