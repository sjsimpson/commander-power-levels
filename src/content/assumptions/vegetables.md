To ensure that a deck can consistently perform at its intended power level, it is also important that the deck doesn’t regularly underperform. We have found that decks most often underperform if they are not “eating their vegetables”.

We separate vegetables into 4 categories:

- _**Ramp:**_ cards you play early game to accelerate your man or core gameplan for the rest of the game
- _**Interaction:**_ cards that protect your game plan and disrupt others
- _**Card Advantage:**_ card that allow you to see more cards and refill your hand
- _**Lands:**_ lands... every deck needs them…

“Vegetables” are the building blocks of a deck, and though they aren’t always part of your main strategy, they enable you to execute that strategy. The biggest difference between power levels is the quality of your “vegetables”.

> \*NOTE: interaction somewhat breaks this rule, as we have found that the density of interaction generally increases with power level.

- :warning: _Maybe a graphic here with a scale on either side “thematic” ← → “powerful and efficient”_

At lower power levels, “vegetables” are often thematic and relatively inefficient.
At higher powers, decks often include the most powerful effects in each category.
