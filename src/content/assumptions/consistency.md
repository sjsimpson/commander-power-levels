Cards that are considerably more powerful than the rest of your deck are considered “power level outliers”. Including such cards (especially in low quantities) doesn’t make a deck “higher power”, but rather, makes it inconsistent.

We believe a good deck is a consistent deck. Not a deck that can win consistently, or consistently “do the thing”, but a deck that consistently performs at its intended power level.

This means that part of power levels starts with intentionality in deckbuilding. Rather than building a deck and then guessing at its power level, you should be picking the power level where you want to play and building a deck to match.

Introspection and understanding of one’s own decks is vital to Rule 0 and Power Levels conversation. How can anyone know the power level of your deck, if you don’t know it yourself?
