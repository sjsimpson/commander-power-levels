Cards that are considerably more powerful than the rest of your deck are considered “power level outliers”. Including such cards (especially in low quantities) doesn’t make a deck “higher power”, but rather, makes it inconsistent.

We believe that a good deck is a consistent deck. Not a deck that can win consistently, but a deck that consistently performs at its intended power level. As such, we start evaluating power levels during deckbuilding and try to avoid “power level outliers” (any card that falls outside of your intended power level).
