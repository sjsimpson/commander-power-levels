While many people will build decks and _then_ seek to evaluate its power level, we find that this can often create problems. Decks may end up including cards and strategies that are inconsistent with one another, or may include [power level outliers](/assumptions#consistency).

Instead, we recommend setting a goal for a specific power level and then building towards it. This will enable you to use the target power level as a way to inform your deckbuilding decisions: how many of each [vegetable](assumptions#vegetables) to add, what kinds of [strategies](influences/strategies) to build around, whether you should play [tutors](influences/tutors) or [combos](influences/combos), etc.

This section includes our [deckbuilding template](deckbuilding/template) and a breakdown of deckbuilding for each vegetable across power levels.
