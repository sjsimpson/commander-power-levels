What will vary most between power levels is the quality of your ramp effects.

- Low-power decks may cost 2-3 mana, enter tapped, and not fix colors. This power level likely doesnâ€™t include rituals or other effects that put your multiple turns ahead on mana.
- Mid-power decks may cost 1-3 mana, enter untapped, fix colors efficiently, and include ritual-style effects.
- High-power decks may cost 0-2 mana, enter untapped, fix colors efficiently, and put you multiple turns ahead on mana.
