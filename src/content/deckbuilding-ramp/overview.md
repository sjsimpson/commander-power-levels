We define ramp as any effect that accelerates your mana either temporarily or permanently during the first 3 turns of the game. This definition includes land ramp such as Cultivate, artifact ramp (also known as “mana rocks”), creatures that can produce mana (often called “mana dorks”), cost reducers, and ritual effects like Dark Ritual.

More mana intensive or explosive effects which may grant a lot of mana over the course of the game, but do not ramp you early, are not included in this definition. Cards like [Smothering Tithe](https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/57/smothering-tithe), [Goldspan Dragon](https://scryfall.com/card/khm/139/goldspan-dragon), and [Old Gnawbone](https://scryfall.com/card/afr/197/old-gnawbone) are all great mana advantage engines, but should not count towards the amount of ramp in your deck.

While much of your ramp will be defined by the play pattern and strategy of your deck, we’ve found that density will remain fairly consistent across power levels with quality being the primary indicator of an increase in power.
