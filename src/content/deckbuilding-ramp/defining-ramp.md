For the purpose of this resource, we define ramp as any effect that accelerates your mana either temporarily or permanently during the first 3 turns of the game. Ramping is one of the best advantages that you can incur early in the game.

This definition includes land ramp such as Cultivate, artifact ramp (also known as “mana rocks”), creatures that can produce mana (often called “mana dorks”), cost reducers, and ritual effects like Dark Ritual.

However, this definition of ramp does not include some of the more expensive or explosive effects that may grant a lot of mana over the course of the game, but does not ramp you early. This includes cards like Smothering Tithe, Goldspan Dragon, and Old Gnawbone. These are all great mana advantage engines, but should not count towards the amount of ramp in your deck.
