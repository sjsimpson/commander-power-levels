To calculate the proper amount of ramp to include during deckbuilding, we used a hypergeometric calculator to examine opening hands in commander games. A “good” opening hand was considered as having 1-2 ramp pieces. Inversely, having 0 or more than 3 ramp pieces in an opening hand was considered disadvantageous. The goal is to see 1-2 pieces of ramp by turn 2.

Based on these calculations, we would recommend that most commander decks should include 13-16 pieces of ramp. Furthermore, it is advantageous to run 13 pieces of ramp unless otherwise needed. The lowest amount of ramp any deck should reasonably run is 10, while the highest is 20.

If you’d like to hear further discussion on how these numbers were reached, watch this video.

Some reasons to include more than 13 pieces of ramp in your deck include a deck or commander that has mana-intensive costs, a deck with a top-heavy mana curve, a high mana value commander that is required for the setup of your strategy, and a theme or strategy that synergizes with ramping.

Higher power level decks may run a slightly higher number of ramp effects in an effort to accelerate their game. They may be willing to sacrifice additional card slots for additional speed.
