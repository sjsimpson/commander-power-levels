This template is meant to provide a safe starting point for deck construction at a _**Mid power level**_. This is not a guide for how every deck should look. Your deckbuilding goals should direct you to make changes based on the power level and strategy of your deck.

1 Commander (or 2 if you are playing with a partner or background)
36 Lands
13 Card Advantage
13 Interaction
13 Ramp
24 Deck-Specific Cards (or 23 if you are playing with a partner or background)

Deck-specific cards may include advantage engines, win-cons, enablers, payoffs, thematic pieces, and cards you find fun to play.

While building your deck, you may find that many cards overlap and can count toward multiple vegetables. You will also find that cards can both count as a vegetable and fit into the theme of your deck (for example, including an effect that draws you cards when a creature dies in your aristocrats-themed deck).
