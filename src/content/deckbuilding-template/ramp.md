The power level of your deck primarily affects the quality of your ramp, but can affect density as well.

### Density

The lowest amount of ramp that most decks should include is 10 pieces. Including 13-16 pieces of ramp in your deck is optimal (weighted towards 13). The most amount of ramp you’d want to include in a deck is 20 pieces.

### Quality

The speed and efficiency of ramp are the primary differentiators of ramp between power levels.

- Low-power decks may cost 2-3 mana, enter tapped, and not fix colors. This power level likely doesn’t include rituals or other effects that put your multiple turns ahead on mana.
- Mid-power decks may cost 1-3 mana, enter untapped, fix colors efficiently, and include ritual-style effects.
- High-power decks may cost 0-2 mana, enter untapped, fix colors efficiently, and put you multiple turns ahead on mana.
