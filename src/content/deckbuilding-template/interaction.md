The power level of your deck affects both the density and the quality of your interaction pieces.

### Density

Most Low-power decks include 8-12 pieces of interaction.
Most Mid-power decks include 12-16 pieces of interaction.
Most High-power decks include 16-20 pieces of interaction.

### Quality

The quality of interaction that you see at each power level is indicative of the kind of threats that you may encounter at that power level.

- Low-power decks may include interaction that is mana-intensive, narrow, or sorcery-speed.
- Mid-power decks may include interaction that is relatively cheap (1-3 mana), flexible, or instant-speed.
- High-power decks may include many of the most efficient effects in the games, including interaction that is free, repeatable, one-sided, and puts you many turns ahead.
