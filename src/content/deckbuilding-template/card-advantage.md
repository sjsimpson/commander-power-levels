The power level of your deck primarily affects the type of card advantage that your deck will include.

### Density

Most decks should include at least 10 card advantage pieces, however 13-16 should be sufficient. A deck needs a reason to want to play more than 16 pieces of card advantage.

### Type

- Low-power decks will include a combination of mostly smoothers and refillers.
- Mid-power decks will include a combination of mostly refillers and engines.
- High-power decks will mostly focus on card advantage engines.
