The amount of interaction that youâ€™ll want to include in your deck will increase as you scale in power level. This allows you to be more prepared to handle [threats](../influences/threat-levels) present at higher power levels.

- [Low-power](../power-levels#low) decks will generally want to include _**8-12 pieces**_ of interaction.
- [Mid-power](../power-levels#mid) decks will generally want to include _**12-16 pieces**_ of interaction.
- [High-power](../power-levels#high) decks will generally want to include _**16-20 pieces**_ of interaction.
