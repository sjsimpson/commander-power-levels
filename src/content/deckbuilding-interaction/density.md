The amount of interaction that youâ€™ll want to include in your deck will increase as you scale in power level. This allows you to be more prepared to handle threats present at higher power levels.

Most Low-power decks will want to include 8-12 pieces of interaction.
Most Mid-power decks will want to include 12-16 pieces of interaction.
Most High-power decks will want to include 16-20 pieces of interaction.
