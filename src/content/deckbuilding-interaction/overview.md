There are 4 main types of cards that we would consider to be “interaction” in deckbuilding:

1. **Reactive Protection**: Effects that can reactively protect your board state and help you maintain the advantages that you have built.
2. **Board Wipes**: Effects that remove threats en masse and help you come back when you are behind on the board.
3. **Targeted Removal**: Effects that get rid of major [threats](../influences/threat-levels) and can deal with many kinds of permanents.
4. **Stack Interaction**: Effects (mostly available in Blue) that help you play proactively to keep threats from hitting the board, and reactively to protect your things from being removed.
