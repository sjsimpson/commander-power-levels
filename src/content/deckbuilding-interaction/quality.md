The quality of your interaction will shift as your power level increases. Here are some signposts you may observe as you consider interaction at various power levels:

Low-power decks may include interaction that is mana-intensive, narrow, or sorcery-speed.
Mid-power decks may include interaction that is relatively cheap (1-3 mana), flexible, or instant-speed.
High-power decks may include many of the most efficient effects in the games, including interaction that is free, repeatable, one-sided, and puts you many turns ahead.
