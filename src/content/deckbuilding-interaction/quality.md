The quality of your interaction will also shift as your power level changes. As you increase in power level you will play more efficient interaction over thematic or synergistic pieces. It is also much more important to be able to interact with the stack at higher power levels.

Here are some signposts to consider at different power levels:

- [Low-power](../power-levels#low) decks may include interaction that is mana-intensive, narrow, or sorcery-speed.
- [Mid-power](../power-levels#mid) decks may include interaction that is relatively cheap (1-3 mana), flexible, or instant-speed.
- [High-power](../power-levels#high) decks may include many of the most efficient effects in the game, including interaction that is free, repeatable, or one-sided.
