### Low

The lowest power decks we play in Commander. Decks in this category do not play “bad” cards by any means, but they typically aren’t playing the best version of any given effect. These decks are often beginner friendly, and prioritize theme over efficiency.

Most precons would be categorized as Low-power. As a result, these decks will often play a less-than-ideal amount of [vegetables](/assumptions#vegetables) or include multiple subthemes.

### Low Mid

These decks are often lightly upgraded or “fixed” precons. This is typically accomplished by removing subthemes and adding more [vegetables](/assumptions#vegetables) to help the deck play more consistently.

These decks are more focused than Low-power decks, as a result of having removed sub-themes in favor of more synergistic choices.

### Mid

Many homebrew decks likely fall into this category. Having cut the least efficient and synergistic cards, Mid-power decks are very focused on their chosen [strategy](/influences/strategy).

These decks will play a greater density of efficient cards, though they still aren’t playing all of the most powerful effects. They will also usually play a greater density of [interaction](/deckbuilding/interaction) to deal with the increasing [threats](/influences/threat-levels).

### High Mid

The hallmark of a High Mid-power deck is card quality. While the [strategy](/influences/strategies) and theme specific cards may look similar to a Mid-power deck, these decks play the most powerful [vegetables](/assumptions#vegetables) to augment their gameplan.

High Mid-power decks may play (and actively look for) [combos](/influences/combos) as a win-condition, but will not play redundancy in the form of broad tutors. [Tutors](/influences/tutors) are often narrow, and are used to search for value pieces rather than outright win-conditions.

### High

The most powerful decks in casual. Though still centered around a theme, these decks are the most powerful version of that theme possible. You will find infinite [combos](/influences/combos) with redundancy in the form of [tutors](/influences/tutors), and the [interaction](/deckbuilding/interaction) to back it up.

These decks play the highest density and quality of interaction in order to back up their own win attempts, and shut down opponents.
