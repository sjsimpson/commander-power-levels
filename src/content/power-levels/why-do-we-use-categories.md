We landed on using 5 categories to classify decks. 10 felt too broad, and there were not many resources that helped players to know where their deck might fall on the scale.

By narrowing to 5 categories and using descriptive language around strategy, card quality, and density of effects for each, we hope to paint a clearer picture of how a deck should be classified and why.

Our 5 categories are:

- [Low](/power-levels#low)
- [Low-Mid](/power-levels#low-mid)
- [Mid](/power-levels#mid)
- [High-Mid](/power-levels#high-mid)
- [High](/power-levels#high)
