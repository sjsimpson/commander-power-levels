We use 5 categories to classify decks. By narrowing to 5 categories and using descriptive language around strategy, card quality, and density of effects at each power level, we hope to paint a clearer picture of how a deck should be classified and why.

Our 5 categories are:

1. [Low](/power-levels#low)
2. [Low-Mid](/power-levels#low-mid)
3. [Mid](/power-levels#mid)
4. [High-Mid](/power-levels#high-mid)
5. [High](/power-levels#high)
