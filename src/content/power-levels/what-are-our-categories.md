### Low

The lowest power decks we play in Commander. Decks in this category do not play “bad” cards by any means, but they typically aren’t playing the best version of a given effect.

These decks will often play a sub-optimal amount of [vegetables](/assumptions#vegetables) or include multiple subthemes. Most precons [info about what a precon is] would be categorized at “Low” power.

### Low Mid

These decks are often lightly upgraded or “fixed” precons. This typically manifests in having added more “vegetables” to help the deck play more consistently.

These decks are more focused than low power decks, having removed sub-themes in favor of more synergistic choices.

### Mid

Many homebrew decks likely fall into this category. Having cut the least efficient and synergistic cards, “Mid” power decks are very focused on their chosen strategy.

These decks will play a greater density of efficient cards, though still aren’t playing the most powerful of any effect. They will also usually play a greater density of interaction to deal with the increasing threats.

### High Mid

The hallmark of a “High-Mid” power deck is card quality. While the strategy and theme specific cards may look similar to “Mid” power, these decks play the most powerful “vegetables” to augment their gameplan.

“High-Mid” power decks may play (and actively look for) combos as a win-condition, but will not play redundancy in the form of broad tutors. Tutors are often narrow, and are used to search for value pieces rather than outright win-conditions.

### High

The most powerful decks in casual. Though still centered around a theme, these decks are the most powerful version of that theme possible. You will find infinite combos with redundancy in the form of tutors, and the “vegetable” suite to back it up.

These decks play the highest density and quality of interaction in order to back up their own win attempts, and shut down opponents.
