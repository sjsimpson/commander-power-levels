Being a responsible deck-builder doesn’t eliminate the need for having Rule 0 conversations, especially when playing outside your regular playgroup. Not everyone is as cool as you and has adopted this system, so it’s good to know how to “tease out” the power level of someone’s deck.

Some good questions to ask are:

- Are you playing tutors? If so, what are you typically tutoring for?
- Are you playing free spells? Which ones?
- How does your deck win? Combos? Combat damage?
- Are you playing fast mana?
- Are you playing extra turn spells?

Don’t be afraid to disclose your win conditions or the powerful cards in your deck to other people. Remember, tournament decklists in other formats are public, so don’t rely on the “element of surprise” to sneak out a win. The primary goal is to make sure decks are matched up fairly, then play to win the game.
