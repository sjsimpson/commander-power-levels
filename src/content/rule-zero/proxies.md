We are generally proponents of proxying cards, due to the sheer amount of deckbuilding we do, but we understand that not everyone is comfortable with this approach. Often, this results in budget becoming a tangential discussion in Rule 0 conversations.

While the most expensive cards aren’t always the most powerful (you can build very powerful decks on a budget), there is certainly a correlation.

Budget is always worth discussing if it’s something your playgroup (or even one person in your playgroup) is concerned with. We have found that discussions around budget are best utilized in conjunction with power level as constraints in the deckbuilding process, not as signposts for power level when you sit down to play.

If budget becomes a problem that is too difficult to solve in your playgroup, please consider proxying. It allows for unrestricted deckbuilding at your desired power level.
