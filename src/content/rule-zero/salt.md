Some decks are naturally more frustrating to play against. Even if you find it fun, someone else may not.

If someone is salty about a deck in your playgroup, or you find a deck particularly “unfun” to play against, have a discussion about it.
What makes it unfun?
Does it belong at a higher power level?

Postgame discussions are just as important for coming to a consensus on play experience as pregame discussions.
