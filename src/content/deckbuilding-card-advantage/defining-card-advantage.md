You’ve likely noticed our use of the term “card advantage” over “card draw”. That’s because we want to consider effects beyond those that net you additional cards in hand.

Card advantage can be broken up into 3 categories: smoothers, refillers, and engines.

### Smoothers

These effects are meant to smooth out your draws early in the game. Smoothers will generally leave you card neutral or minimally card positive. This includes effects that grant card selection (as opposed to card draw) or cantrip (replace themselves by letting you draw a card).

Most Red card advantage spells act as smoothers and present some sort of card selection. Examples of this include “impulse” draw effects and Thrill of Possibility style cards that net you 0 cards but offer card selection.

Smoothers act as low-level redundancy in your deck, helping you find more card advantage, interaction, ramp, lands, and key pieces of your strategy. They are dependent on the play pattern of your deck and can allow you to spend early turns smoothing your hand before enacting your game plan.

Examples: Brainstorm, Thrill of Possibility, Faithless Looting, Night’s Whisper, Cut a Deal

### Refillers

These effects are meant to refill your hand later in the game. As you empty your hand throughout the course of the game, refillers play an important role in making sure you don’t run out of gas. These cards generally will net you 2 or more additional cards in your hand at a time. You are generally casting refillers on turn 6 or later to restock your hand and continue pushing your game plan forward.

Examples: Windfall, Harmonize, Stinging Study, Return of the Wildspeaker, Wheel of Misfortune

### Engines

At higher power levels, you generally want to focus on deploying card advantage engines. These effects are meant to draw you cards continuously throughout the course of the game. Engines are generally better to deploy early so you can generate the most amount of advantage possible.

Examples: Rhystic Study, Trouble in Pairs, Dark Prophecy, Garruk’s Uprising, Faerie Mastermind
