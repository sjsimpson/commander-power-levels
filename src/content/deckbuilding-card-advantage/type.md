While the amount of card advantage in your deck doesnâ€™t vary drastically due to power level, the composition of your card advantage does change.

- [Low-power](../power-levels#low) decks will include a combination of mostly _**smoothers and refillers**_.
- [Mid-power](../power-levels#mid) decks will include a combination of mostly _**refillers and engines**_.
- [High-power](../power-levels#high) decks will mostly focus on card advantage _**engines**_.
