While the amount of card advantage in your deck doesnâ€™t vary drastically due to power level, the composition of your card advantage does change.

Low-power decks will include a combination of mostly smoothers and refillers.
Mid-power decks will include a combination of mostly refillers and engines.
High-power decks will mostly focus on card advantage engines.
