A deck needs at **least 10 pieces** of card advantage to function consistently. **13-16 pieces** is likely sufficient, with a deck needing a good reason to want to run more than 16 pieces.

Some things that can influence the amount of card advantage in your deck include:

- The [strategy](../influences/strategies) of the deck (does your deck “care” about drawing cards?)
- The play pattern of the deck (when are you trying to play your commander?)
- The amount of redundancy in the command zone and the rest of your deck ([tutors](../influences/tutors), for example)
- The colors available to you (some colors just have higher quality card advantage).
