In most cases, a deck needs at least 10 pieces of card advantage. 13-16 pieces is likely sufficient, with a deck needing a good reason to want to run more than 16 pieces.

Some things that can influence the amount of card advantage in your deck include the strategy of the deck (does your deck “care” about drawing cards?), the play pattern of the deck (when are you trying to play your commander?), the amount of redundancy in the command zone and the rest of your deck (tutors, for example), and the colors available to you (some colors just have higher quality card advantage).
